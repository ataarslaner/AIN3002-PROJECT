## Introduction
Neural networks often suffer from overfitting, where they perform well on training data but fail to generalize to new, unseen examples. Dropout is a regularization technique that addresses overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training, forcing the network to learn robust representations and reducing reliance on specific features. This project aims to investigate the impact of dropout on neural network performance and compare it with other benchmark regularization methods.
